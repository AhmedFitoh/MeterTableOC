Audio Controller Meter Table

An Objective-C version of the MeterTable.cpp sample code provided by Apple

Converts dB to a 0 to 1.0 scale. Suitable for binding to a UIProgressView/NSProgressView

This saves you from needing to add cpp files to your project which adds difficulty to exercises like refactor or convert to ARC in XCode.
